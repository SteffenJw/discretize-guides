The <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Condi Scourge"/> is an easy build to learn and provides access to good off-support tools (large amounts of passive barrier from <Trait id="2059"/>) and can be augmented to provide the means of a safety net at an acceptable amount of DPS loss with the Blood Magic trait line (without any stat changes). 

The build can place lots of  conditions and crowd control on multiple targets simultaneously with its shades. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> in combination with its other tools, it is quite self-substantial. 

Additionally it can also corrupt boons when <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" /> is active and has a large supportive toolkit with lots of CC and utility skills like <Skill name="Corrosive Poison Cloud"/> and <Skill name="Trail of Anguish"/>, which can be invaluable on some T4 Fractals.

### Traits
<Traits traits1="Curses" traits1Selected="Plague Sending, Master of Corruption, Lingering Curse" traits2="Soul Reaping" traits2Selected="Unyielding Blast, Soul Barbs, Dhuumfire" traits3="Scourge" traits3Selected="Fell Beacon , Sadistic Searing, Demonic Lore"/>
### Alacrity Scourge
To provide <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, your gear and traits remain mostly the same. Make sure to play with <Skill name="Sand Flare"/> using it during downtimes.

If you are still struggling to maintain <Boon name="Alacrity"/> or have low <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>, you may want to use it more frequently during the combat or simply take some Ritualist gear for some extra <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/>. 

Unlike a full dps <Specialization name="Scourge"/>, you are supposed to use <Skill name="Sand Cascade" /> off cooldown. You will want to play <Skill name="Summon Shadow Fiend"/> or <Skill name="Spectral Grasp"/> as your third utility choice, for additional Life Force generation. 

<Skill name="Desiccate"/> is an alternative if your group lacks <Boon name="Fury"/> or will benefit from th  8 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> and provides Life Force as well.   

The final change is to take the following traits in the <Specialization name="Scourge"/> traitline:
<Traits traits1="Scourge" traits1Selected="Fell Beacon,heraldofsorrow,Desert Empowerment"/>

### Situational Traits

#### Insidious Disruption

On [99CM](/fractals/sunqua-peak/) there is no need to play any Life Force generating utility skill. 

Therefore take <Skill name="Plague Signet"/> in combination with <Trait name="Insidious Disruption"/> instead of <Trait name="Plague Sending"/>, to gain a significant dps gain. 

#### Blood Magic

Running Blood Magic instead of Soul Reaping can be an option if you need more team revival power via <Trait name="Ritual of Life"/> and <Trait name="Transfusion"/> and more sustain in general. It will cause a personal damage loss but it can be helpful if your party is having trouble staying alive.

<Traits traits1="Blood Magic" traits1SelectedIds="780, 1844, 778"/>
<Warning>
Taking <Trait name="Banshees Wail"/> will bring some more CC via the warhorn skill <Skill name="Wail of Doom"/>.

### Shade Skills

In order to utilise shade-skills you either place a shade onto your target or stay within 180 range yourself.

- Maintain at least 1 shade at all times.
- Using your shade skills will add additional applications of <Condition name="Burning"/> (from <Trait name="Dhuumfire"/>), <Condition name="Torment"/> and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> (from <Trait name="Unyielding Blast"/>). 
- Make sure to cast <Skill name="Nefarious Favor"/> and <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/> on cooldown.
- Any excess Life Force can be used on <Skill name="Sand Cascade" />, as long as you are not delaying your priority shade skills.
- Your <Trait name="Dhuumfire"/> trait has an internal cooldown of one second. Be sure to space out your <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/> and <Skill name="Sand Cascade"/>) instead of blindly spamming them off cooldown.
- Casting your <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/> on the group will provide large amounts of barrier passively through your rotation. They can also be used on other significant targets such as the Anomalies in the [Shattered Observatory](/fractals/shattered-observatory) fractal. A <Specialization name="Scourge"/> counts as a shade activator itself and will also hit any targets within the range of your shade abilities.
- Additionally shade effects do not stack, they only expand the area in which they get applied.


### Notes

- You want to combo <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> and <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/> together to take advantage of <Trait name="Plague Sending"/>. Use <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/> as you cast <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> to ensure you transfer the right conditions (the self caused <Condition name="Bleeding"/> and <Condition name="Torment"/> from <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> specifically).
- <Trait name="Plague Sending"/> has a 6s effect duration after using <Skill name="Desert Shroud"/>, transfering the next conditions you'll get within that window.
- If your group has multiple Scourges, you can all take <Skill name="Summon Bone Minions"/> and <Skill name="Summon Bloodfiend"/> to replace <Skill name="Signet of Undeath"/> with a different utility skill of choice (provided all Scourges use their <Skill name="Putrid Explosion"/> skill off cooldown and <Skill name="Taste of Death"/> during downtimes).
- If you're using <Skill name="Summon Shadow Fiend"/>, you should use <Skill name="Haunt"/> off cooldown as it has no cast time.

### Filler Priority
18. <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/> (at 0/3 shades)
19. <Skill name="Plaguelands"/>
20. <Skill name="Harrowing Wave"/>
21. <Skill name="Oppressive Collapse"/>
22. <Skill name="Signet of Spite"/>
23. <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/>

### Shorter Phases/Exposed
The Opener/Golem Rotation above is not taking in account <Effect name="Exposed"/> and can be adjusted to shorter "burst" windows.

To do so start on Scepter, eventually utilising a double <Skill name="Blood is Power"/> Opener e.g. at [Dark Ai](/fractals/sunqua-peak/) with side CC, to ramp up group <Boon name="Might"/> and a early <Skill name="Signet of Spite"/> stacking conditions based on their durations.

This allows you to delay your Pistol and Torch skills up to right before getting your 10s of <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
