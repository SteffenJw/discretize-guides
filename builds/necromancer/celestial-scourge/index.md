The <Specialization name="Scourge" text="Celestial Alacrity Scourge"/> is an easy build to learn and provides excellent support in the form of barrier, <Boon name="might"/>, <Condition name="vulnerability"/> and crowd control.
 
This build works for several reasons:
- Most of its support comes through barrier and not actual healing, this means that it does not really benefit from outgoing healing modifiers, allowing for more offensive choices compared to the traditional Heal Scourge builds.
- Barrier application bypasses healing debuffs like <Condition name="Poisoned"/> and <Effect name="Agony"/>, allowing you to effectively "heal" through <Instability name="Toxic Trail"/>, <Instability name="Flux Bomb"/> and other mechanics that apply one, both or other similar effects.
- Except for <Skill name="Manifest Sand Shade"/> all your shade skills are instant casts, low cooldown and can be spammed on cooldown through the Life Force generation from <Trait name="Fear of Death"/>, <Trait name="Eternal Life"/>, <Skill name="Weeping Shots"/>, <Skill name="Vile Blast"/> and <Skill name="Harrowing Wave"/>.
- It has ridiculous amounts of condition cleanses, effectively nullifying the damage pressure of mechanics like <Instability name="Afflicted"/> or the Imbued Shaman from [Volcanic Fractal](/fractals/volcanic). 
- It has both built-in and acess to high amounts of hard and soft [CC](/guides/cc-distribution/).
- Even though it can only give <Boon name="Fury"/> through <Skill name="Desiccate"/>, most quickness and DPS [builds](/discretize.eu/builds) give themselves or the group permanent or high uptimes, allowing you to take other support or offensive utilities. 


The build is not locked to any utility skill, you should pick and choose depending on what your party may need. For example, you may swap out <Skill name="Desiccate"/> if you don't have to cover fury, <Skill name="Trail of Anguish"/> if you don't need the <Boon name="Stability"/> and <Skill name="Serpent Siphon"/> if you can't make use of the <Boon name="Aegis"/>.

<Divider text="General Information"/>
- Any [Punishment type skill](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Punishment) will corrupt one boon from enemy targets.

### Shade Skills

In order to utilize shade-skills you either place a shade onto your target or stay within 180 range yourself.

- Maintain at least 1 shade at all times.
- Using your shade skills will add additional applications of <Condition name="Torment"/> and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> (from <Trait name="Unyielding Blast"/>). 
- The standard setup will allow you to spam all shade skills on cooldown.
- <Skill name="Nefarious Favor"/> will convert one condition on allies to a boon.

- <Skill name="Garish Pillar"/> will apply 2 seconds of <Condition name="Fear"/>, heal, teleport to you and partially revive downed allies through <Trait name="Transfusion"/>.
- <Skill name="Sandstorm Shroud"/> will pulse 4 times barrier, 2 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and heal allies through <Trait name="Abrasive Grit"/>, <Trait name="Herald of Sorrow"/>, <Trait name="Desert Empowerment"/> and <Trait name="Life from Death"/>

A <Specialization name="Scourge"/> counts as a shade activator itself and will also hit any targets within the range of your shade abilities.
- Additionally shade effects do not stack, they only expand the area in which they get applied.

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">
This build does not have an actual rotation or a skill priority, most of your skills will be used on cooldown unless you need to delay them to deal with mechanics, your shade skills are instant casts and your utilities are going to be changed and used whenever necessary.
