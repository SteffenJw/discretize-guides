The <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is one of the professions with the most support and utility. It provides permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>, and if that is not enough already, the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has also excellent CC capabilities with <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> and <Skill name="Darkrazorsdaring"/>.

Damage-wise the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is on the lower end compared to the other damage dealing classes. This does not imply that the damage doesn't matter; in fact <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has a very juicy burst that makes slacking DPS players sweaty.

Since the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is a power-oriented build it benefits from <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Information>
<Specialization name="Renegade"/> requires 33.3% <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> minimum to maintain <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, pressing <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> off-cooldown. Due to the nature of most fractal encounters, <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> close to this can safely be run thanks to precasting and short phases/fights (especially when precasting with a high <Attribute name="Boon Duration"/> gearset). If you want more room for error and safer uptimes, use the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) to adjust your build.

When playing <Specialization name="Renegade" text="Power Renegade"/>, both Staff and Greatsword are valid choices as a second weaponset and situationally optimal depending on the group and encounter. In T4 Fractals, due to most defiance bard requiring 800cc and <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> applying an instant 600 CC, Greatsword is the recommended choice for more damage.

In CMs there is a larger CC contribution requirement, however with builds such as <BuildLink build="Heal Chronomancer" specialization="Chronomancer"/> and <BuildLink build="Power Scrapper" specialization="Scrapper"/> providing large amounts of CC, along with contribution from DPS builds, in a lot of cases you can play Greatsword. However if CC is non-existant in your party it may be a better option to take Staff to provide the extra CC yourself.

If you do play Greatsword on CMs, On Artsariiv, you should take <Item id="24639"/> on Greatsword to instantly break 2 clones in the 33% split with <Skill name="Jade Winds"/>. On Arkk it is generally better to play Staff to break the Defiance Bar instantly unless you are in a speedkill.   

**Please consider which weapon best fits your group based on both its needs and speed. Arguments for both are valid for almost every fight.**

<Warning>

Note that with a build like <Specialization name="Scrapper"/>, <Specialization name="Virtuoso"/>, <Specialization name="Scourge"/>, or <Specialization name="Specter"/> who can strip boons while doing their rotation, you shouldn't have to deal with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> on most fights. Although there will be some T4s where you will need to help and also on Arkk and MAMA depending on the build.
</Warning>

There are multiple weapons in your arsenal to deal with the instability <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> and make it easier to manage the boons that the enemy will receive from this instability (the internal cooldown is 20 seconds). For fractals with <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> it is recommended to run a staff with <Item id="72872"/> instead of a <Item id="24615"/>. The <Item id="72872"/> will transfer three boons from enemies to you when you interrupt an attack. For enemies with a defiance bar, using a CC skill while the enemy is casting any ability counts as interrupting, even if there is no "_interrupted_" message. This can also be run on Greatsword or Sword instead of <Item id="24868"/> if necessary, and the boonstrip can be procced with <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/>.

As for legends that you want to run due to a lack of boonstrip in a group, the general rule of thumb is to run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/>. When you can't remove the boons with <Item id="72872"/>, use <Skill name="Banish enchantment"/> in <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/>.

If you find the stability to be an issue on fights where <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> isn't enough to cover the <Boon name="Stability"/>, you can run <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Demon Stance"/>. Alternatively heavily rely on your <Item id="72872"/> to strip the boons and run <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>. However, this isn't recommended due to the unreliability of <Item id="72872"/>.

### **General Rotation Guide**
#### Energy Management:

<Specialization name="Renegade"/> has lower cooldowns than many other classes at the cost of its other mechanic, energy. Energy is replenished over time as indicated by the arrows to the left and right of the energy indicator. Every arrow indicates 1% point of energy gained/lost per second. 
All skills cost energy so plan accordingly. Remember, your primary job is to give <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, <Boon name="Might"/>, and CC. Then your burst damage. This can be initialy difficult to learn, so here are a few tips:

1. **Plan your play:** This also comes down to knowing the fight well. For example, just before a split phase like at Artsariiv, casting <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> may not be worth it. <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> needs 6 seconds to share <Boon name="Alacrity"/> to your Group. It is better to use the 20 Energy to Burst instead.


2. **Drain your energy:** You want to almost always take advantage of <Trait name="Charged Mists"/>. As a result, legend swapping off cooldown is the best way to take advantage of that. Using <Skill name="Impossible Odds"/> and <Skill name="Heroic Command"/> are examples of things you can do to drain your energy. Certain weapon skills can do that as well.

3. **Plan your skill costs:** Often times, you will want to know the energy costs of your skills before certain phases. For example, <Skill name="Orders from Above"/>, <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> and <Skill name="Icerazor's Ire"/> are often used in conjunction with a weapon skill like <Skill name="Eternity's Requiem"/> before legend swapping in a few boss phases. This is a total cost of 75 energy minimum to execute. 

#### Kallas Fervor
<Uncategorized name="kallasfervor"/> gives 2% strike damage, 2% condition damage and 2% life-steal damage per stack, for a maximum of 5 stacks. Stacks are obtained every time you critically strike a foe. Using <Skill name="Eternity's Requiem"/> or <Skill name="Chilling Isolation"/> is an easy way to reach 5 stacks.

#### Important Traits
1. <Trait name="Brutal Momentum"/>: Increased damage if endurance is full. Dodging will lose this trait and also lose crit cap. If dodging is necessary, cast <Skill name="Unrelenting Assault"/> or <Skill name="Imperial Guard"/>.

2. <Trait name="Unsuspecting strikes"/>: Increases your DPS in the first 20% of the fight so ensure a clean opener (see above for rotation)

3. <Trait name="Swift Termination"/>: Increases your DPS in the last 50% of the fight. Try to use burst skills in this window, but not worth overly delaying skills.

4. <Trait name="Charged Mists"/>: When legend swapping, try to go below 10 energy to proc this trait, resulting in 75 energy on the next legend. This allows for more burst skills to be cast.

5. <Trait name="All for One"/>: This trait gives a 10% strike damage increase for every <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/> ability used. You ideally want to maintain this buff throughout both legends. To do so, make sure to cast <Skill name="Icerazor's Ire"/> twice in Kalla, once at the beginning and once at the end of the loop.
