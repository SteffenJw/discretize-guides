<Specialization text="Power Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> is currently the strongest power build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals. It can bring a decent amount of CC while offering good burst damage and great sustained DPS while being able to adapt to different groups and situations by bringing tons of extra utility such as <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Effect name="Stealth"/>, reflects, pulls or portals from the <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> toolkit. You will also naturally provide boon removal through <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> and <Trait name="Vicious Expression"/> as well as potentially <Trait name="Shattered Concentration"/>, which makes the specialization particularly useful in unorganized pug compositions. At an organized level, it falls behind soulbeast and dragonhunter particulaly because <Specialization text="Power Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> has no ability to precast traps before starting a boss. 

As a class, <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> provides an optimal skipping toolset for T4 fractals which should be utilized. This build profits from sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

For fractals, due to <Effect name="Exposed"/>, it is worth adjusting the build to make use of <Item id="24868"/>. An important advantage of having an impact sigil setup is also that it allows for easy sigil swapping. This is relevant because on Dark AI <Item id="36053"/> and on Siax as well as Ensolyss <Item id="24658"/> provide even better damage boosts. <Item id="24664"/> works on Eparch. <Item id="36053"/> also works on several strike missions. Furthermore, <Item id="24575"/> can be used on some raid encounters and in open world. Hence, if you do not own a build already, across all content, the impact sigil setup will provide you higher damage and greater flexibility. It is smarter to also play the impact build in raids than the accuracy build in fractals. Ideally, you own both setups.

Check the [gear optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/) for more gear variants!

Note: This setup assumes you use stat infusions and standard utility. If you do not use stat infusions, <Item id="82791"/> is a damage increase.  Additionally, the optimal gear for power virtuoso will change depending on different combinations of <Item id="91805"/>, <Item id="43360"/>, <Item id="9443"/>, <Item id="50082"/> and <Item id="73191"/>! The resulting difference is negligibly small though. Two impact sigil gear sets are mainly provided because the eagle setup uses fewer precise infusions while the potion setup keeps deadeye runes. Choose whatever is more convenient.

For fractals, due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> it is worth adjusting the build to make use of <Item id="24868"/>. However, if you do not want to use multiple builds for different content, the sometimes suggested raid build using <Item id="24618"/> is also okay to run. If you don't own a build already, it is smarter to bring the impact sigil build to raids than the accuracy sigil build to fractals.

Note: This setup does not use stat infusions. Stat infusion setups can be found in the advanced tab.

### Weapon Choices
The default weapon setup is spear + dagger and sword. For more burst in very short phases, one can experiment with spear + gs in conjunction with <Trait name="Bountiful Blades"/> as it could sometimes be advantageous. If you do not own the necessary expansions or find it otherwise advantageous, greatsword + dagger and sword is the oldschool setup. Make sure to swap out impact sigil for better slaying sigils or night sigil where appropriate. In very fast kills with sufficient stun uptime, swapping out force sigil instead is beneficial.

### Situational Traits

|                                                            |                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Trait name="Shattered Concentration" size="big" disableText/> | Take this trait if you want to help strip boons. |
| <Trait name="Bountiful Blades" size="big" disableText/> | Take this trait if you're playing with Greatsword. |

<Traits traits1Id="24" traits1="Illusions" traits1SelectedIds="721,729,733"/>

You can go this Illusions variant over the Domination traitline when you're facing <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime issues to be more self-sufficient in bad groups, if you're also lacking <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> consider going <Trait name="Persistence of Memory" size="small"/> as well.

<Advanced>
<Traits traits1Id="59" traits1="Mirage" traits1SelectedIds="2113"/>

Utilize Mirage for skips!

<Trait name="Elusive Mind"/>, <Skill name="Jaunt"/> and <Skill name="Mirage Thrust"/> along with the typical Mesmer toolset makes it really good for mobility and skips.

<Traits traits1Id="40" traits1="Chronomancer" traits1SelectedIds="1978,2022"/>

Situationally used for <Skill name="Continuum Split"/>, which can be useful when stealthing your group with <Skill name="Mass Invisibility"/> or any utility you want to use twice. Additionally allows for shield to be equipped giving you a very strong block with <Skill id="30769"/> and <Skill id="29649"/>. In niche cases can be used for some self <Boon name="alacrity"/> through <Trait name="Flow of Time"/> and <Trait name="Improved Alacrity"/>.

<GridItem sm="5">
### Extra Weapons and Food
- Focus offers your group a very efficient pull with <Skill name="Into the Void"/>.
- Greatsword offers additional burst, but sacrifices the ability to precast dagger skills like <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/>.
- Sword offers an evade, mobility and additional boonstrip when used as mainhand weapon.
- Always run Spear. 
- Use sigil swapping where appropriate to gain additional damage.
- Use <Item id="43360"/> for fights with adds for an additional damage boost. 
- Use <Item id="50082"/> in the entire Nightmare Fractal and on Arkk for an additional damage boost.

<Advanced>

- You can run Pistol instead of Focus on fights with multiple enemies when deciding to run this variant as <Skill name="Phantasmal Warden"/> does not always attack your target.
- Greatswords, Swords, Pistols and Foci with <Item name="Night" type="Sigil" disableText/>, <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil" disableText/> and other slaying sigils.
- Torch for stealth, blasting, and precasting
- Riffle for precasting and certain skips
- Staff for precasting at certain bosses.
- Shield for blocks if you are skipping with <Specialization name="Chronomancer"/>

</Advanced>

### Situational Skills

Swap out <Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/> before any other skill. If you cannot use  <Skill name="Mimic"/>
to precast  <Skill name="Rain of Swords"/> or you need additional might from mantra of pain, you can consider swapping out rain of swords instead. An example boss for this scenario is Dark AI.

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill usage"/>

<Warning>

Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

It's important to note that phantasms do not benefit from most modifiers unless it is stated to be the case.

They do however benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
</Warning>

<Grid>
<GridItem xs="12" sm="7">





### Skill Priority

To play <Specialization text="Power Virtuoso" name="Virtuoso"/> in fractals, you need to adapt on the fly as phantasms are slower than skills from other classes. There are no fixed opening rules for every single boss and group. Starting from the classic raid benchmark rotation, experiment what works best for your group. The guiding principle is to get as many skill casts as possible into each phase. In that regard, on many fights where the boss spawns invisible or delayed, you can get an advantage by precasting AoE skills which do not require a target such as 
<Skill name="Rain of Swords"/>, <Skill id="62597"/> or <Skill id="62607"/>. <Skill id="10174"/> gives you the buff <Trait name="Fencers Finesse"/> and hence should be used as soon as possible. If you realize that your phantasms will not finish their attacks before the boss will phase, do not cast them anymore. 

If you lose yourself in the rotation, follow this priority list:
1.  Cast your phantasms whenever ready.
    - <Skill id="10174"/>
    - <Skill id="10267"/>
    - <Skill id="10221"/>
    - <Skill id="72946"/>
2.  Use <Skill id="21750"/> to recharge them all.
3.  Use <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/> with 5 Blades as much as possible. Only delay it for <Effect name="Exposed"/> but remember that it also grants you a 5% damage buff through <Trait name="Deadly Blades"/>.
4.  Use <Skill name="Bladesong Sorrow"/> and <Skill id="62597"/> for damage and to keep up the buff from <Trait name="Deadly Blades"/>. Make sure to prioritize having 5 Blades for <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/> though. Situationally you can use this with 5 Blades such as in your burst rotation or when a phase is about to end and <Skill name="Bladesong Harmony"/> is on cooldown.
5.  <Skill id="62553"/> deals damage over time so make sure to cast it at the start of phases. If a boss is close to phasing, save it for the start of the next phase.
6.  Use <Skill id="62560"/>, <Skill id="62607"/>, <Skill id="10333"/> and <Skill id="10218"/> off recharge.

- <Skill name="Illusionary Riposte"/> is a DPS increase if you time it well, and don't interrupt other casts.

Remember that your personal damage skills are faster than phantasms, but that they deal more damage over time, this means that direct damaging skills such as <Skill id="62560"/> and auto-attacks get higher priority if the boss is close to phasing.

Utilize <Skill name="Bladesong Dissonance"/> for CC, but also remember to not use too much CC on the break bar and space out your big CC cooldowns like <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> so they don't overlap with other powerful CC skills.

Apart from doing DPS, you'll also have access to a wide range of utilities which can all be used for skips, blocks, and damage mitigation. Make sure to read what they do and don't be afraid to swap to them situationally, especially in T4s.


### Dark AI Example 
Dark AI is <Specialization text="Power Virtuoso's" name="Virtuoso"/> best boss as <Skill name="Feedback"/>
can be used to reflect her laser beams. Furthermore, if phased to 66% or 33% during her dash animation, the boss will use additional 'bugged' laser beams which - if reflected - will boost your damage beyond 100k for a phase. As inside the fractal there is nighttime, <Item id="36053"/> works and will additionally boost your damage. Use <Skill name="Mimic"/> at the Mistlock Singularity to reset your first <Skill name="Feedback"/> cast at the start of the fight. The normal laser beams spawn in segments. A long dash contains 10 beams in a 4-2-4 sequence. With multiple reflect sources, one person wants to reflect at the start of the dash and another person at the end. A typical composition contains a <Specialization name="Scrapper"/> using <Skill id="30088"/> for reflects. Hence, mesmer players should reflect at the end of her dashes. For normal kill times, feedback should be up for each dash. In below 1 minute kills, one has to save feedback when gambling on the 33% reflect bug. With great dps, it is possible to phase the boss to 66% during the second dash, which will also result in additional beams. However, a bugged 33% reflect seems to contain even more beams than a bugged 66% reflect. Due to the boss movement and necessity to combine  <Skill name="Mimic"/> with <Skill name="Feedback"/> , <Skill name="Rain of Swords"/> is inferior on the fight and should be replaced rather than <Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/>. If you notice might drops, recharge the mantra. <Skill name="Phantasmal Defender"/> is also an option, especially with multiple mesmer players, as it triggers <Trait name="Superiority Complex"/>, which will increase your reflect damage early on if you plan on phasing her before she completes the second dash. Reflect damage uses your ferocity and modifiers, but your enemies' power. As far as the rotation is concerned, this fight is long enough to resemble a raid rotation. Make sure to help cc the adds if your groups is not prepared to skip them with sufficient dps and break the boss as late as possible. One add explosion can be tanked with <Effect name="Rigorous Certainty"/>. Support players should tank the tether at 33% in order to prevent damage reduction from <Effect name="Cacophonous Mind"/>, but it is better that you do it than noone. Due to its long fight duration, depending on the current balance, <Specialization text="Condition Mirage" name="Mirage"/> or potentially even <Specialization text="Power Mirage" name="Mirage"/> or <Specialization text="Power (Boon) Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/>  could work on the fight, as well. Power mirage has the highest reflect damage. Condition Mirage has the highest mobility and highest damage potential without using reflects.

<Card title="Precasting">

At the Mistlock Singularity

- Make sure to start with 5 Blades. If you need use <Skill name="Blade Renewal"/> to replenish them.

1. Blast fire fields with <Skill name="The Prestige"/>.
2. Use <Skill name="Inspiring Imagery"/> (Careful its Ethereal Combo Field)
3. Extend boons with <Skill name="Signet of Inspiration"/> if you have time.
4. Precast <Skill name="Mimic"/> and take the singularity when your group is done pre-buffing.
5. Additionally you can precast a <Skill name="Time Warp"/> on the boss and take the singularity as well on bosses like Skorvald, or any boss if you use portals.

At the boss (spawnable bosses)

1. Cast <Skill name="Rain of Swords"/>. Skip this step if you did not use <Skill name="Mimic"/> at the singularity.
2. You can precast <Skill name="The Prestige"/> and <Skill name="Chaos Storm"/> to squeeze out a little more burst, if your group coordinates.
3. Cast <Skill name="Rain of Swords"/> (again).
4. Start casting <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> if the boss starts with a break bar.

At the boss (pre spawned bosses)

- You can also precast <Skill name="Phantasmal Warlock"/>.

<Card title="Improving Further">
The most important aspect is having the correct gear for each boss. It is free damage.
Once you are comfortable with the general steps above, you are already doing most of the full rotation and will be able to deal great damage.

There will be a few additional fight and group specific things to improve further, but if you got here, you already know the most important things and these will have a smaller impact than what you learned so far. 

Videos are the best resource to understand how a boss can be played. However, Virtuoso is currently specalization used in the main Slb/Dh + Scrapper and Ren composition, potentially limited PoVs exists.  

In any case, check out the [dT discord](https://discord.com/invite/tgbxThQv) if you have further questions.
