The <Specialization text="Power Alac Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> is currently the strongest boon build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals.  

Despite having longer ramp-up times compared to <Specialization text="Power Alac Renegade" name="Renegade"/>, it is strong for PuGs and gets suboptimal the faster groups gonna get, especially at Arstariiv due to the lack of <Boon name="Resistance"/>.  
  
To succeed as a <Specialization text="Power Alac Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> in higher-end groups you'll need to be able to **adapt** your rotation and push the limits of your class.

You'll provide boon removal through a various range of options, especially by utilising <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> and <Trait name="Vicious Expression"/>. 

The <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> provides an optimal skipping toolset for T4 fractals, which should be taken advantage of.

If necessary the build can bring its own <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> making it rather self-sufficient.

This build profits from sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

<Item id="100947"/> instead of <Item id="100916"/> will increase your personal target damage, but eventually trade of cleave damage on Skorvald/Arkk/MAMA. 

For PuGs we recommend to stick with <Item id="100916"/> due to overall longer phase times.

Use the [Gear Optimizer](https://optimizer.discretize.eu/?m=fractals) to customize your gear.

Make sure to run <Item id="24868"/> in fractals in order to exploit <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
On some encounters, <Item id="36053"/> (Sunqua Peak),  <Item id="24658"/> (Siax, Ensolyss) and <Item id="24664"/> (Eparch) can provide even better damage boosts. On top of that, <Item id="43360"/>,  <Item id="50082"/> or <Item id="73191"/> can situationally be used as damage increase.

### Weapons Choices

Always use Greatsword in combat.

#### Off-hand

While Sword off=hand is your highest damage weapon choice, both Shield and Focus can be used situationally. It is recommended to run focus in trash heavy T4s as standard.

**Shield:**
- <Skill name="Echo of Memory"/> and its flip skill <Skill name="Deja Vu"/> can be used for blocks.
- <Skill name="Tides of Time"/> can provide an additional 8 group <Boon name="Might"/>

**Focus:**
- <Skill name="Temporal Curtain"/> is a 5 target pull
- <Skill name="Phantasmal Warden"/> mitigates projectiles

### Situational Traits

<Traits traits1="Illusions" traits1Selected="Shatter Storm,Phantasmal Haste,Phantasmal Force" unembossed/>

You can go play Illusions over Domination when you're facing <Boon name="Quickness"/> uptime issues to be more self-sufficient in bad groups, if you're also lacking <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> consider going <Trait name="Persistence of Memory" size="small"/> as well.

<Trait name="All's Well That Ends Well"/> can be taken for an additional group sustain.

#### Traits for Skips
While we don't recommend leaving your party during boss fights, when dealing with sections of trash mobs, <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> has fantastic utility to speed these sections up, often allowing your party to ignore sectrions of some fractals entirely, using Blinks, <Effect name="Stealth"/>, and <Effect name="Superspeed"/>. Some traits you will find useful for this are:
- <Trait name="Temporal Enchanter"/> - This will let you provide <Effect name="Superspeed"/> to yourself and your party.
- <Trait name="Prismatic Understanding"/> - This will increase the duration of <Effect name="Stealth"/> gained from skills such as <Skill name="Mass Invisibility"/> and <Skill name="Veil"/>.
- Utilize Mirage for skips when moving across large distances or you need leaps! <Trait name="Elusive Mind"/>, <Skill name="Jaunt"/> and <Skill name="Mirage Thrust"/> along with the typical Mesmer toolset makes it really good for mobility and skips.

| <Skill name="Portal Entre" size="big" disableText/>         | For skipping sections of the fractal for your party.                                                                                                                                       |

### Skill priority
To play <Specialization text="Power Alacrity Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> in fractals you need to adapt on the go, as [Phantasms](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Phantasm)/[Wells](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chronomancer#Utility) are our main damage source, but also slower than most skills of other classes.



If you lose yourself in the rotation follow this priority list:

1.  On Greatsword, <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> is your strongest skill and should be used of cooldown to be able to get three usages before swapping (utilising <Skill name="Signet of the Ether"/>).

2.  On Sword, <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/> follows the same principle.

3. You want to use your utility skills in the following priority:
  
   1. <Skill name="Well of Calamity"/>
   2. <Skill name="Well of Action"/>
   3. <Skill name="Gravity Well"/> (when no CC is required)
   4. <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> / <Skill name="Well of Senility"/> if taken and not required for their utility!  

4.  You should use a charge of <Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/> off cooldown and, the final charge should be used at the end of phases in fights with periods of downtime long enough for the skill to recharge.

5.  Ideally, <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/> can be used three times and <Skill name="Mind Stab"/> twice. On Dagger/Sword you basically prioritise the same way <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/> twice as well and <Skill name="Bladecall"/> three times.

7. If close to phasing, remember that your direct damage skills hit quicker than Wells and Phantasms, so therefore should be prioritised.

</GridItem>
<GridItem sm="6">
### Shatters
Even though casting Phantasms already covers a large portion of the necessary Alacrity uptime, shatters take an important part as well thanks to <Trait name="Stretched Time"/>.

Most fractal encounters include downtimes in between their phases, which means that you would want to make use of as many Clones as possible, to build up spare uptime.

Make sure to cast <Skill name="Split Second"/> on cooldown and ensure to keep three Clones for this one, since it's your main damage Shatter.

As long as that requirement is matched, you can freely use any spare Clones on <Skill name="Rewinder"/>; and <Skill name="Time Sink"/> (as long as there is no upcoming defiance break).

### Continuum Split
<Skill name="Continuum Split"/> rewinds all your skills back to the status they have been while entering.
The duration depends on the numbers of Clones spent, but usually two Clones are the optimal amount.

Your goal should be to cast as many high priority skills during that time window, to be able to cast them twice as often as usual. 

Since your Shatters will get rewound as well, you can shatter **all** of them for additional Alacrity.

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill usage"/>

<GridItem xs="12" sm="6">

### Information
Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.  

It's important to note that Phantasms do not benefit from most modifiers unless it is stated to be the case.

They do, however, benefit from <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

### Opener
Example with <Skill name="Continuum Split"/>:
- <Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/> would usually be your dps choice if there is no need for <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> or <Skill name="Well of Senility"/> 

- Start on Dagger/Sword

1. **Precast** finished
   1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Disenchanter"/> on <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain" /> days without a defiance bar
   2. or <Skill name="Signet of Humility"/> + <Skill name="Time Sink"/> if the boss has a defiance bar (strips NPNG as well)

1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/>
1. <Skill name="Bladecall"/> -> Weapon Swap
1. <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/>
   1. <Skill name="Illusionary Wave"/> if the boss has a defiance bar 
 
1. <Skill name="Well of Calamity"/> (<Skill name="Continuum Split"/>)
   1. <Skill name="Well of Action"/> (<Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/>)
   2. <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> 
   3. <Skill name="Signet of the Ether"/>
   4. <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/> (<Skill name="Split Second"/>) + remaining shatters
   5. <Skill name="Mind Stab"/> -> <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/> (<Skill name="Continuum Split"/> ends)

1. <Skill name="Well of Calamity"/> (<Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/>)
1. <Skill name="Well of Action"/>
1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/>
1. <Skill name="Signet of the Ether"/>
1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Berserker"/>
1. <Skill name="Mirror Blade"/>
1. <Skill name="Mind Stab"/>
1. Weapon Swap
1. <Skill name="Phantasmal Swordsman"/>
1. <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/>
1. <Skill name="Bladecall"/>
2. remaining stacks of <Skill name="Mantra of Pain"/> 

</GridItem>

<GridItem xs="12" sm="6">
<Card title="Precasting">
At the Mistlock Singularity

1. <Skill name="Time Warp"/>
2. <Skill name="Well of Action"/>
3. <Skill name="Tides of Time"/> 
4. <Skill name="Continuum Split"/>
   1. <Skill name="Split Second"/>, <Skill name="Rewinder"/>, <Skill name="Time Sink"/> and <Skill name="Distortion"/>
5. <Skill name="Split Second"/>, <Skill name="Rewinder"/>, <Skill name="Time Sink"/> and <Skill name="Distortion"/>
6. <Skill name="Mimic"/>
7. Take the Mistlock Singularity
8. Adjust utility skills for the encounter

At the boss

- Use <Skill name="Well of Calamity"/> before your <Skill name="Mimic"/> timer runs out.
- As long as you are not already in combat cast <Skill name="Tides of Time"/> and swap to your combat set.
- Depending on the phase length and if CC is required, you can also precast <Skill name="Gravity Well"/> or <Skill name="Well of Senility"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Unstable Bladestorm"/>.

</Card>
### Rotation Adjustments
The opener takes around 15s and <Skill name="Continuum Split"/> has 70s cooldown with permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. 

Now it is up to you to figure out how many usages you can get at a certain fractal encounter and which phases would even be long enough to recommend using it.

Often times you won't even have access to all the skills that got used in the opener above, or maybe you still gonna have cooldown on your Weapon-Swap.

Based on that, another approach could be to by-pass phases with low resources by duplicating the few options you have.

Otherwise double-casting Wells only makes sense at 9s+. Therefore you could also precast them, skipping their cast times during the actual phase, while still taking advantage of most of the pulsing/final damage.
