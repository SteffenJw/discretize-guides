The <Specialization name="Catalyst" text="Power Catalyst"/> is a strong DPS build for fractals. <Specialization name="Catalyst" text="Power Catalyst"/> provides conjures and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, as well as some <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/> and <Boon name="Protection"/> through _Spheres_. Additionally it can blast fire fields and potentially extend boons with <Skill name="Sand Squall"/>. It may also swap traits and gear to provide permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> and a decent amount of extra <Boon name="Might"/>. It is also very useful for some T4 skips in fractals like Aetherblade, Cliffside, Thaumanova Reactor etc. thanks to high mobility and <Skill id="5536"/>.

This build has less burst than <Specialization text="Power Weaver" name="Weaver"/> but offers extra utility through the boons of the Jade Spheres. <Specialization name="Catalyst" text="Power Catalyst"/> might not be a common pick for fractals but it's main advantage compared to other power classes commonly taken there, is a general elementalist benefit, the trait <Trait name="Bolt to the Heart"/> which heavily boosts your dps output in later phases during fights. 

This build unlike <Specialization text="Power Weaver" name="Weaver"/> has higher survivalbility due to 20% extra stats from <Trait name="Elemental Empowerment"/>. Some defensive utilities are available in <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> but you will be using them during your normal rotation and not always be in that attunement when you need the defense, and in <Skill name="Water Attunement"/> which you mostly don't use due to short phases and can be saved for when you need heal or cc. 

This build has a relatively hard rotation considering the specifics of fractal CM bosses but is very enjoyable to play - if given some dedication. The build benefits heavily from slaying potions and sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

### Situational Weapons
#### Hammer
Can be used as a perfectly viable replacement for sword/warhorn that can achieve equal results in most cases. 

#### Hammer in CMs
Playing Hammer means that you can do either air opener or fire opener, this depends on whether you can fit 2 or 1 <Skill name="Lightning Storm"/> during the encounter (if you can fit only 1 it is beneficial to open in fire and precast <Skill id="5736"/>). The main disadvantage of hammer is being unable to maintain or rebuild stacks once there is any downtime without anything to hit (or any field below you) and thus missing on a major dps modifier. 

#### Hammer in T4s
Hammer is the recommended option for normal tier 4 Fractals. It has the highest sustain due to <Skill name="Rocky Loop"/>, a free block with <Skill name="Immutable Stone"/>, condi cleanse with <Skill name="Cleansing Typhoon"/> and a significant amount of healing with <Skill name="Crashing Font"/>. If your group is struggling to stay alive either because you don't play with a healer or the instabilities are making it difficult you can consider replacing <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/> with <Skill id="25491"/>. This provides a very strong burst heal and condi cleanse for you and your allies with <Skill id="25492"/>. Additionally you can even consider replacing fire traitline with water traitline for a dps loss but another big boost in sustain for both you and your group through <Trait name="Soothing Mist"/>, <Trait name="Soothing Power"/> and <Trait name="Healing Ripple"/> thus making Catalyst a great choice overall for this content.

### Jade Spheres

As a Catalyst, your unique class mechanic is the energy system and your Jade Sphere.

- You build up energy by attacking your enemy up to a maximum of 30.
- Your F5 skill will cost 10 energy and cast a Jade Sphere based on your current attunement, for example <Skill id="63458"/>.
- Your Jade Spheres damage enemies and provide boons to allies while they are active. They also act as combo fields.
- This means, that even on the full DPS build you will provide some boons to help out the group.

Certain traits interact with your sphere, namely:

- <Trait name="Spectacular Sphere"/> makes your Spheres grant an extra boon based on the attunement. At the same time it allows you to provide <Boon name="Quickness"/> with every sphere.

- <Trait name="Sphere Specialist"/> doubles the duration of the boons applied, making it possible to provide higher boon uptime when traited with <Trait name="Spectacular Sphere"/>.

### Weapon Skills

Sword/Warhorn is a very straightforward set, you want to use every high damaging skill and fill with auto attacks in between.

- Learning the icons of each attack in the auto attack chain can be helpful to make sure that you always complete it. In air and fire the final auto looks like an upwards facing sword <Skill name="Searing Slash"/> <Skill name="calllightning" profession="elementalist" />
- <Skill name="Wildfire"/>, <Skill name="Lightning Orb"/>, <Skill name="Cyclone"/> and <Skill name="Dust Storm"/> proc the fireworks buff.
- <Skill name="Polaric Leap"/>, <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/> and <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/> are combo finishers and the main contribution to <Trait name="Elemental Empowerment"/> and <Trait name="Empowering Auras"/> stacks.

Some of your weapon skills bring nice extra utility, like:

- <Skill name="Earthen vortex"/> acts as a dodge.
- <Skill name="Water Globe"/> heals and provides a water field.
- <Skill name="Tidal Surge"/> heals and provides <Boon name="Regeneration"/>.
- <Skill name="Sand Squall"/> extends boons, acts as a blast and grants <Skill name="Magnetic Aura"/>. 

These can sometimes be quite handy but earth attunement and it's skills are used in the rotation so they might not be up when you need them. Water attunement is rarely used (mostly on Ensolyss) so you can use it during downtime if neccessary. Attuning to water is beneficial for damage if you have enough energy for it's sphere and <Skill name="Tidal Surge"/> is off cd. 

### Utility Skills

As a Catalyst, you gain access to augments. You will be using two of them by default, namely <Skill name="Relentless Fire"/> and <Skill name="Shattering Ice"/>. Other augments listed in the situational skills section can also be useful.

Augments grant you a buff and gain a bonus effect when cast near their corresponding sphere. This is usually either a duration increase for the buff or a cooldown decrease for the skill.

For example, <Skill name="Relentless Fire"/> will grant you a damage increase for 5 seconds. This is increased by 3 additional seconds when cast near a <Skill id="63458"/>. Therefore, you usually want to use them in the corresponding attunement.

### Elite Skills

Conjures are specific to the Elementalist class.

- Casting a Conjure skill will give the weapon to you as a bundle replacing your weapon skills and leave one copy on the ground for yourself or an ally to pick up.
- In fractals, you will mostly use these to precast additional damage at the start of the fight and between phases. Some Conjures will be used only for CC.

The most common Conjure you will be runnning most of the time is <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/> (FGS).

- <Skill name="Firestorm"/> is the most used skill on this weapon. It deals constant damage in the targeted area and can therefore be precasted before the fight or between phases for extra burst.
- <Skill name="Fiery Rush"/> can be used to rush you to the enemy and is therefore great for mobility, for example moving to your assigned add during the 2nd Siax split phase. 
- <Skill name="Fiery Whirl"/> is also great for mobility to get back from your split add during Siax. 

<Skill name="Elemental Celerity"/> can replace fgs on some bosses with equal or better results. More specifically: 
- If you can use it twice during the fight (but fgs only once) or if you can cast <Skill name="Firestorm"/> only once in total, then it is worth replacing <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/> (Skorvald, Arkk. Ensolyss).
- In cases where you can get 2x <Skill name="Firestorm"/> but only 1 <Skill name="Elemental Celerity"/>, <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/> is better (Artsariiv, MAMA, Siax).

Notes:
- The above examples are taking into account a relatively fast group, the slower your group is the more adjustments you need to consider making.
- If you play with <Skill name="Elemental Celerity"/> then <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/> should always be precasted before you take the mistlock.

### Trait Interactions

<Trait name="Empowering Auras"/> is a buff unique to Catalyst. It grants a 2% outgoing damage buff capping at 5 stacks.

Traits that interact with Elemental Empowerment stacks are:

- <Trait name="Empowering Auras"/> gives you a stack whenever you gain an aura.
- <Trait name="Elemental Epitome"/> provides you an aura every time you combo. Actively helping to blast <Boon name="Might"/> at the Singularity is therefore even more beneficial, even if you just do it for your DPS.

<Trait name="Elemental Empowerment"/> is a buff unique to Catalyst. It grants a 1% bonus to all stats capping at 10 stacks.

Traits that interact with Elemental Empowerment stacks are:

- <Trait name="Vicious Empowerment"/> gives 2 stacks whenever you disable a foe. Your disables are <Skill name="Polaric Leap"/> and <Skill name="Cyclone"/>.
- <Trait name="Elemental Empowerment"/> gives 3 stacks while in combat.
- <Trait name="Elemental Epitome"/> makes your combos give an aura and each aura give a stack. This interaction has a 10s internal cooldown for each attunement, so performing a combo in a specific attunement means that any other combo in said attunement won't be giving you any stacks until that time frame passes. 
- <Trait name="Empowered Empowerment"/> doubles the effectiveness at 10 stacks and grants 50% effectiveness at less than 10 stacks (DPS build only).

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill usage"/>

<Information>
Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

### Step-by-Step Rotation

This is a step-by-step explanation of the Catalyst rotation. A mostly complete written rotation and some extra info can be found in step 3. The steps do not indicate what skills do the most damage, it merely demonstrates a possible way to learn the rotation. Keep in mind that this rotation is performed on a standard average golem, on bosses with shorter phases and/or downtime in between although the general idea will be the same, there might be adjustments you need to make.

**Step 1: Attunement Order, Auto Attack Chains and Damaging Skills**

In the first step, we will take a look at weapon skills.

1. Start in <Skill name="Air Attunement"/> and cast <Skill name="Polaric Leap"/>, <Skill name="Lightning Orb"/>, <Skill name="Cyclone"/>, <Skill name="Quantum Strike"/>
2. Swap to <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/> and cast <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/>, <Skill name="Wildfire"/>, <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/>
3. Perform 3x Auto Attack Chains until <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/> is ready again to be used
4. Cast <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/> and swap to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and cast <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/>, <Skill name="Dust Storm"/>, <Skill name="Rust Frenzy"/>
5. Swap back to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/> and perform 3x Auto Attack Chains
6. Repeat from step 1 

This will give you a basic idea of what skills are important, how their cooldowns line up and how the auto attack chain functions. 

**Step 2: Jade Sphere and Utilities**

Now it is time to take a look at the Jade Sphere and Utilities, namely <Skill name="Relentless Fire"/>, <Skill name="Arcane Blast"/> and <Skill name="Glyph of Storms"/>. Augments become stronger when cast near the corresponding Sphere. You will have enough energy to cast your Jade Spheres in Air, Fire, and Earth. Use the Augment right after casting the corresponding Sphere. Use Arcane Blast in Fire because that is where you have the highest damage modifiers on you. Keep in mind that spheres are instant cast actions so they can be used immediately when you swap attunements as long as you have the energy required. 

1. Start in <Skill name="Air Attunement"/>, precast <Skill name="Lightning Storm"/>, cast <Skill id="62940"/> and cast <Skill name="Polaric Leap"/>, <Skill name="Lightning Orb"/>, <Skill name="Cyclone"/>, <Skill name="Quantum Strike"/>
2. Swap to <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/>, cast <Skill id="63396"/>, followed by <Skill name="Relentless Fire"/> and cast <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/>, <Skill name="Wildfire"/>, <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/> then Auto Attack x3 until <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/> is off cd
3. Cast <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/> and swap to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>, cast <Skill id="62837"/> and cast <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/>, <Skill name="Dust Storm"/>, <Skill name="Rust Frenzy"/>
5. Swap back to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/> and Auto Attack x3
6. Repeat step 1 (without glyph of storms since it will be on cooldown)

Try to use spheres back to back when possible (for example from air to fire) because that way you minimize the 5 seconds internal cooldown that exists until you can start generating energy again.

**Step 3: Elite Skill, Water Attunement, Firestorm and Wildfire**

Glyph of storms gives you 4 different options depending on your attunement and the ones you want to be using are <Skill id="5736"/> and <Skill name="Lightning Storm"/>. Lightning storm is the strongest option but with a high cooldown so if you know you won't be able to use lightning storm in every phase or again in the entire fight, you can fit a firestorm somewhere in between and end with a lightning storm. Keep in mind that you heavily benefit from being able to precast <Skill id="5734"/> whenever you can. If you have <Skill name="Elemental Celerity"/> slotted it can be used to either reset air skills or fire skills. 
The rotation will look like this:

1. Start in <Skill name="Air Attunement"/>, precast <Skill name="Lightning Storm"/>, cast <Skill id="62940"/> and cast <Skill name="Polaric Leap"/>, <Skill name="Lightning Orb"/>,<Skill name="Cyclone"/>, <Skill name="Quantum Strike"/>
2. Swap to <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/>, <Skill id="63396"/>, followed by <Skill name="Relentless Fire"/> and  <Skill name="Arcane Blast"/>, <Skill name="Wildfire"/>, <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/>, <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/>, <Skill name="Elemental Celerity"/>, <Skill name="Wildfire"/>, <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/>, <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/>
3. Swap to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and cast <Skill id="62837"/>, <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/>, <Skill name="Dust Storm"/>, <Skill name="Rust Frenzy"/> 
4. Swap to <Skill name="Water Attunement"/>, cast <Skill id="62723"/> and <Skill name="Tidal Surge"/>
5. Swap back to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/> and Auto Attack x3
6. Repeat step 1 (without glyph of storms and elemental celerity since they will be on cooldown)

Attuning to water is normally part of the rotation in the opener and after that when you have <Skill name="Tidal Surge"/> off cd and enough energy for both <Skill id="62837"/> and <Skill id="62723"/>. On most fractal bosses there won't be enough time to attune to water due to how short phases are (exception being Ensolyss). You can save that attunement for cc or emergnecy healing.

**Step 4: Skill Queuing and Cancelling Aftercasts**

After learning what skills to press and in what order the last thing is to learn how to queque them and how to cancel some aftercasts. Skill quequing means that you can always click the next skill you want to press as long it can't interrupt your previous one (<Skill name="Polaric Leap"/> and <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/> can do that for example) so as the action happens immediately when the previous animation is done. You can also use a skill while you are switching attunements which is done with <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/>, <Skill name="Quantum Strike"/>, <Skill name="Cyclone"/> and <Skill name="Rust Frenzy"/>. 

Aftercasts are animations that keep happening even after all the damage a skill can do has been applied to the target. They can be avoided by interrupting them with another skill. For example <Skill name="Rust Frenzy"/> has a long aftercast that can be interrupted with <Skill name="Polaric Leap"/>. 

In fractals, you will mostly use Conjures to precast skills at the start of the fight or between phases. The most important skills are <Skill name="Invoke Lightning"/> from <Skill name="Conjure Lightning Hammer"/> as well as <Skill name="Firestorm"/> from <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/>.

<Card title="Precasting">

If a _Mistlock Singularity_ is present, you should precast your personal buffs and/or boons to boost your performance. Not precasting in fractals is gonna severly hurt your damage since building up your specific buffs takes a while and bosses phase fast. More specifically it takes ~3 seconds to get to 10x <Trait name="Elemental Empowerment"/> and ~6 seconds to get to 5x <Trait name="Empowering Auras"/> if you don't precast anything.

To deal with that issue the easiest precast you can do before interacting with _Mistlock Singularity_ is by having a staff in your other set. Start in <Skill name="Water Attunement"/>, use <Skill name="Ice Spike"/> and <Skill name="Frozen Ground"/>, swap to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and use <Skill name="Magnetic Aura"/> and <Skill name="Transmute Earth"/>. This grants you the maximum amount of stacks right away, which you should also refresh with <Skill name="Sand Squall"/> and extent boons for you and your allies. 

Note: <Skill name="Frozen Ground"/> is an ice field and it can interfere with the general group precast which relies on a fire field for might. If you want to do this kind of precast then simply place your field a bit outside of the group while still being in range to receive their boons. An ice field is neccessary because it is the only field which gives 2 auras once you blast it and thus 2 stacks. 

But if you don't want to go that way, as an elementalist, you also have easy access to fire fields and blasts providing <Boon name="Might"/> as well as <Trait name="Elemental Empowerment"/> and <Trait name="Empowering Auras"/> stacks. In that scenario you only need a Scepter in your other set, you can start in fire and perform the following sequence: 

1. Start in <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/> and cast <Skill name="Wildfire"/> to provide a fire field. 
2. Blast it using <Skill id="5675"/>.
3. Use <Skill id="5692"/> while switching to <Skill name="Water Attunement"/>
4. Wait for the combo to finish in <Skill name="Water Attunement"/> and swap to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/>
5. Blast using <Skill name="Arcane Brilliance"/>
6. Attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and blast with <Skill name="Sand Squall"/>
7. Switch to back to Sword
8. Precast <Skill name="Conjure Fiery Greatsword"/> 
9. Take the _Mistlock Singularity_.

This puts you at 5 stacks (4 from each combo in each attunement and 1 from the aura you gain when you use <Skill name="Sand Squall"/>). It might be a bit more complicated and time consuming but it blasts a fire field 4 times meaning 12 might. Keep in mind that <Trait name="Empowering Auras"/> stacks last for 10 seconds from the moment you last refreshed them meaning you want to start the fight before they expire so as you can instantly refresh them with <Skill name="Polaric Leap"/>.

</Card>

### Extra Info

- It was made clear in previous sections how important <Trait name="Empowering Auras"/> are but other than precasting them, you also need to be able to maintain them in between phases or build them up if needed. There are 2 ways to do that: 1) you can combo in an attunement that you don't normally use, which is <Skill name="Water Attunement" disable text/>. You can provide a field for yourself with <Skill name="Water Globe"/> and blast it with <Skill name="Arcane Brilliance"/>, 2) you can refresh your stacks with <Skill name="Sand Squall"/> at any given moment as long as you can attune to earth. 
- If the downtime is longer (for example skorvald islands or ensolyss capture phases), keep in mind that attuning to fire refreshes your stacks or gives you 1 if you have dropped them, because of <Trait name="Sunspot"/> and you can perform extra combos by providing a field with <Skill name="Flame Uprising"/> and blasting it with <Skill name="Earthen Vortex"/>.
- This is mostly relevant if you decide to play hammer but hammer orbs can't be precasted anymore because they dissapear on weapon swap. If you play hammer on certain bosses you can do an additional precast with either <Skill name="Meteor Shower"/> or <Skill name="Lightning Orb"/> after casting <Skill name="Firestorm"/> depending on your opener (make sure to not get in combat on the wrong weapon set).
