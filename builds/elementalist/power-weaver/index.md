<Advanced> 
The <Specialization name="Weaver" text="Power Weaver"/> is currently a strong DPS builds for fractals. <Specialization name="Weaver" text="Power Weaver"/> provides conjures, <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, and additional <Boon name="Might"/> through placing fire fields and blasting them. Also it is very useful for some T4 skips like Aetherblade, Cliffside, Thaumanova Reactor etc. thanks to high mobility and <Skill id="5536"/>.

Unfortunately, this build depends pretty much on supports and boon uptimes, as it can't provide any boons itself besides some <Boon name="Might"/> by blasting fire fields. This build has one of the most fluid rotations in-game which makes it enjoyable to play if given some dedication. The build benefits heavily from slaying potions and sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Serpent Slaying" type="Sigil"/>.

Although Warhorn off-hand has a higher benchmark, in general for fractals Dagger is the better all round choice due to offering more CC with <Skill name="Updraft"/>. Additionally, it is better suited to shorter phases and <Effect name="Exposed"/>, due to Daggers burst damage being more compressed. For Warhorn to compete with burst, <Skill name="Wildfire"/> needs to be precasted which can be harder to achieve.

<Beginner>

The <Specialization text="Power Weaver" name="Weaver"/> is a build that offers high burst damage and good consistent DPS while bringing some utility in the form of sharing conjures like <Skill name="conjurefierygreatsword" /> as well as providing some <Condition name="Vulnerability" /> and some <Boon name="Might" /> through placing and blasting fire fields.

Due to the build lacking any form of boon self-generation as well as being rather squishy, this build heavily relies on the supports for boon uptime to reach its full potential. 

The advanced page provides a more complete overview of all the utilities the <Specialization name="Elementalist" /> has to offer. Once you can execute the step-by-step rotation provided below without spending too much thought on it and are confident with the utility options provided here, head over and check out the advanced page for some extra information. Feel free to swap to the advanced page early if you feel like you are missing some information on additional (less common) utility skills or trait swaps.

### **Burst priority**

<Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> bursting options and priority:

Keep eye on boss HP/<Effect name="Exposed"/> duration to optimize the <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> burst priority there are 3 options for that burst:

- <Skill name="Fire Grab"/> -> <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/> -> <Skill name="Ring of Fire"/>

When phases are that fast that you are not sure to get both hits with <Skill name="Fire Grab"/> + <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/>, OR When <Effect name="exposed"/> window is tight and you have time to cast only one of those skills within it. <Skill name="Fire Grab"/> has **ALWAYS** higher priority than other two skills in <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/>

- <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/> -> <Skill name="Ring of Fire"/> -> <Skill name="Fire Grab"/>

When you have enough time to use all those skills within phase time/<Effect name="exposed"/> window or its situation like Skorvald/Siax phase 2 where you delay your <Skill name="Fire Grab"/> like that to let it hit with <Trait name="Bolt To The Heart"/> modifier

- <Skill name="Ring of Fire"/> -> <Skill name="Cauterizing Strike"/> -> <Skill name="Fire Grab"/>

When there are a lot of adds around and you have time to hit both burst skills within <Effect name="exposed"/>/phase time. That option gives additional <Trait name="persisting flames"/> stacks before burst.

Outside of this:

- Try to finish your auto-attack chains (<Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Searing Slash" disableText/> and <Skill name="Air Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Call Lightning" profession="elementalist" disableText/>).
- Use <Skill name="Arcane Blast"/> when the target's defiance bar is broken and you have <Trait name="Elements of Rage"/> and <Skill name="Conjure Lightning Hammer"/> up.
- On small hitboxes <Skill id="5736"/> is better than <Skill name="Lightning Storm"/>, use it while attuning to <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>.

</GridItem>
<GridItem>
<Card title="Precasting">

If you do not have dedicated <Boon name="Might"/> provider in your party, you should prestack <Boon name="Might"/> as much as possible. Preferably with 100% boon duration, since you do not any self generated <Boon name="Might"/> like other classes do.

### **Weaver Precast**

- Start on <Skill id="5495"/>/<Skill id="5492"/> with your Sword/Dagger and cast <Skill id="5691"/> to provide a fire field.
- Blast it using <Skill id="40709"/>, then attune to <Skill id="5492"/>/<Skill id="5495"/> and cast <Skill id="5690"/>, <Skill id="21656"/> and <Skill id="5522"/> for extra blasts.
- Precast <Skill id="5506"/> and <Skill id="5635"/>, and swap back to <Skill id="5734"/> and <Skill id="5539"/>.
- Equip a staff and cast <Skill id="5516"/> or <Skill id="43638"/> while attuning to <Skill id="5494"/>/<Skill id="5492"/>.
- Take the _Mistlock Singularity_.

It is recommended to use separate precast templates to easily make use of different utility skills and weapons. Allowing you to precast multiple buffs, boons, and skills easily.

### **Other advice**

- If you have spare time before the encounter becomes active
  - Start in <Skill name="Air Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>
  - Precast <Skill name="Meteor Shower"/> on staff, attune to <Skill name="Air Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Air Attunement" disableText/> while casting, then swap back to sword/dagger after the cast. 
  - When there is an available _Mistlock Singularity_ but the party is not going for a full precast (mostly in t4s) at least precast <Skill id="5516"/> for yourself.
  - Choosing between <Skill id="5516"/> and <Skill name="Weave Self"/> as elite skill depends on phase time, and if you are able to utilize the second <Skill id="5516"/>, and other factors such as CC skills. 
- On some bosses you can precast <Skill name="Conjure Lightning Hammer"/> to pick it up later in the fight.
- You can precast <Skill name="Conjure Frost Bow"/> on some bosses for other players in your group to pick up, for example the Alacrity <Specialization name="Renegade"/>

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill usage"/>

<Information>
Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.

### Step-by-Step Rotation

**Step 1: Attunement Rotation + Dual Attacks**

We will start with the basic rotation of attunements as well as pressing the 3rd skill off-cooldown. As a <Specialization name="Weaver" />, we will be attuned to 2 elements at once with the main one deciding our 1st and 2nd skill, the secondary one deciding our 4th and 5th skill, and the combination deciding our 3rd skill.

1. We will start the rotation in <Skill name="airattunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="airattunement" disableText/>.
2. Then we will swap through <Skill name="fireattunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="airattunement" disableText/>
3. into <Skill name="fireattunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="fireattunement" disableText/>
4. and back through <Skill name="airattunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="fireattunement" disableText/>
5. into <Skill name="airattunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="airattunement" disableText/> and repeat.

We will use 3rd skill off-cooldown in each attunement combination. Make sure to not delay your attunement swap, even if a skill is almost off-cooldown. If you are in the middle of an auto-attack, try to finish it before casting your skill, but do not worry about auto-attack chains until you are more comfortable with the rest of the rotation.

**Step 2: Weapon Skills**

Next up, we will incorporate more weapon skills, namely <Skill name="flameuprising" />, <Skill name="ringoffire" /> and <Skill name="firegrab" /> in <Skill name="fireattunement" /> as well as <Skill name="ridethelightning" /> in <Skill name="airattunement" />.

- After swapping to <Skill name="fireattunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="airattunement" disableText/>, use <Skill name="flameuprising" />, followed by <Skill name="ridethelightning" /> and <Skill name="pyrovortex" />.
- In <Skill name="fireattunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="fireattunement" disableText/>, use every skill that is up, then wait for <Skill name="flameuprising" /> and finally swap back to <Skill name="airattunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="fireattunement" disableText/>.
- <Skill name="firegrab" /> will not always be up at the same time. Use it whenever it is up, but do not delay your attunement swaps waiting for its cooldown.

**Step 3: Primordial Stance**

It is now time to start using <Skill name="primordialstance" /> that works in the following way:

- This is an instant-cast skill that deals damage every second and inflicts a condition based on your current attunement.
- We will want to get as many uses in <Skill name="fireattunement" /> as possible.
- The first tick happens 1 second after casting it.

So to maximize the damage, we will use 1 charge each time after swapping to <Skill name="fireattunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="airattunement" disableText/>.

**Step 4: Glyph of Storms and Fiery Greatsword**

Lastly, we will try to improve our burst damage significantly by using <Skill name="firestorm" profession="bundle" /> and <Skill name="glyphofstorms" /> in <Skill name="airattunement" /> at the start of the fight or slightly before the fight starts. They are also great to cast at the beginning of a new phase if they are off-cool down.

- Both of these skills can be cast shortly before the fight starts as their effects will persist.
- <Skill name="glyphofstorms" /> will be used in <Skill name="airattunement" />. This skill can also be quite useful in <Skill name="earthattunement" /> outside of boss fights to inflict <Condition name="Blinded" /> on multiple enemies.
- If a Mistlock Singularity is present, you can cast <Skill name="conjurefierygreatsword" /> there to have another one during the fight. Otherwise, you can cast it before a boss or on the way to the boss as it is also great for mobility. Use <Skill name="firestorm" profession="bundle" />, then drop it and use <Skill name="glyphofstorms" />.

<Card title="Improving Further">

Once you are comfortable with the above steps, you are already doing a large part of the full rotation and will be able to deal great damage.

There will be a few additional things on the advanced page to improve further but if you got here, you already know the most important things and these will have a smaller impact than what you learned so far.

The additional steps are:

- Finishing auto-attack chains when possible, <Skill name="calllightning" profession="elementalist" /> in <Skill name="airattunement" /> and <Skill name="searingslash" /> in <Skill name="fireattunement" />.
- Incorporating <Skill name="arcaneblast" /> into the rotation.
- Learning when to use different utility skills for extra DPS depending on hitbox size/phase timings such as <Skill name="conjurelightninghammer" />.
- Learning rotations using <Skill name="weave self"/>, these add <Skill name="Water Attunement"/> and <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> increasing your damage and making your rotation even more fluid.
