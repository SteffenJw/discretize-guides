The **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** is an unique build that can be played very effectively in [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) and Silent Surf CMs (this build can also be an attractive choice for other CM and T4 encounters with longer phases, like Ensolyss, if you find yourself in a slow group).

Condi <Specialization name="Weaver"/> can deal very high amounts of damage, and even rival strong builds like <BuildLink build="Condi Holosmith" specialization="Holosmith"/> and <BuildLink build="Condi Specter" specialization="Specter"/> when played properly.

This build is naturally tanky due to its rotation, having above 90% uptime on the <Skill name="Rocky Loop"/> buff. On top of that damage reduction, it has permanent 10% DR from <Trait name="Geomancer's Training"/> and 7% DR on ~ 40% uptime from <Trait name="Stone Flesh"/>. 

The main downside of **<Specialization text="Condi Weaver" name="Weaver"/>** apart from the complexity of its rotation is the lack of unique party buffs and overall boon generation, apart from some <Boon name="Might"/> generated by <Skill id="25486"/>.

#### Situational Traits
|                                                              |                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Trait name="Pyromancers Puissance" size="big" disableText/> | Can easily cover a large amount of <Boon name="Might"/> for your group at a minor personal DPS loss. This build can't generate any <Trait name="Persisting Flames"/> stacks so the dps loss comes only from the time you need until your own might ramps up. |
| <Trait name="Masters Fortitude" size="big" disableText/>     | Provides a bit of tankiness in the form of extra vitality for minimal DPS loss.                   |

### Situational Skills

<Warning>

If you do want to switch any of your utilites in favor of one of the skills listed below, you should prioritise dropping <Skill name="Glyph of Elemental Power"/> before <Skill name="Primordial Stance"/> and <Skill name="Signet of fire"/>.

</Warning>

|                                                                   |                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heal                                                              |
| <Skill name="Arcane Brilliance" size="big" disableText/>          | An additional <Boon name="Might"/> source from blasting fire fields. Overall provides less healing than <Skill name="Signet Of Restoration"/>. |
| <Skill name="Glyph of Elemental Harmony" size="big" disableText/> | A stronger alternative healing skill when you need to restore a large amount of health very quickly.                                           |
| <Skill name="Aquatic stance" size="big" disableText/>             | Another alternative healing skill affecting allies close to the target you strike.                                                             |
| Offensive                                                         |
| <Skill name="Glyph of Lesser Elementals" size="big" disableText/> | A stronger alternative to <Skill name="Glyph of Elemental Power"/> but relies on rng and works better in fights with longer phases.   
| Defensive                                                         |
| <Skill name="Arcane Shield" size="big" disableText/>              | A stun break with the addition of 3 blocks.                                                                                                    |
| <Skill name="Armor of Earth" size="big" disableText/>             | Another stun break that provides extra <Boon name= "Protection"/> and <Boon name= "Stability"/>.                                               |
| <Skill name="Stone Resonance" size="big" disableText/>            | A strong skill providing a lot of barrier and extra <Boon name= "Stability"/>.                                                                 |
| <Skill name="Twist of Fate" size="big" disableText/>              | Yet another stun break with the addition of evade frames.                                                                                      |
| Utility                                                           |
| <Skill name="Lightning Flash" size="big" disableText/>            | A 900 units teleport for easy repositioning.                                                                                                   |
| <Skill name="Glyph of Renewal" size="big" disableText/>           | You can sacrifice some DPS for a powerful insta rez, can be very useful during "Dancing with Demons" runs.                

### Situational Weapons
- **Scepter** - A lower dps option that is fully ranged and opens up the offhand slot.
- **Warhorn** - Your first choice of off hand, useful if your group struggles with boon uptime due to access to <Skill name="Sand Squall"/>.
- **Focus** - Less dps than warhorn but offers higher cc and more situtional utility in the form of condi cleanse with <Skill name="Magnetic Wave"/> and invulnerability with <Skill name="Obsidian Flesh"/>.

</GridItem>
</Grid>

<Divider text="Rotation / Skill usage"/>
<Warning>
Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.  
</Warning>

### Important Notes

- <Skill name="Signet of Fire"/> is one of your most important DPS skills. Use it off cooldown!

- Make sure to always use <Skill name="Glyph of ELemental Power"/> in <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/>. If the boss is about to phase or die, your next best option is to use it in <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>. If you find yourself is any other element, you should use it regardless, as it grants increased strike damage on your next few attacks.

- <Skill name="Primordial Stance"/> should be used before attuning to <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> for maximum damage output. However, if the boss' breakbar is about to be broken or about to phase, you can also use it during <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> or <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>.

- Although it is important to follow the weave self rotation as closer as possible, the timing when it comes to completing it, is extremely tight and you might find yourself unable to do it especially if you don't have boons precasted on you and they have to be applied once you get in combat. In that scenario the best adjustment you can do is slightly altering the ending. Instead of doing the <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> => <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> => <Skill name="Water Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> loop, do this one: <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> => <Skill name="Water Attunement" disableText/><Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>, use <Skill name="Triple Sear"/> and activate <Skill id="69184"/> there, attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Water Attunement" disableText/>, use <Skill name="Whirling Stones"/>, activate <Skill id="69413"/>, move to <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> and continue with the main loop. 

- In the video, a 2nd <Skill name="Weave Self"/> rotation is shown, which is the same as the 1st. If the encounter has downtime due to phases in between when the boss can't be damaged and <Skill name="Weave Self"/> comes off cd then you can freely attune to air and start from the opener. If it doesn't and you know the boss is going to phase before you need to finish the weave self loop, then you can use <Skill name="Weave Self"/> right away the moment it comes off cd in the attunement you are in and only switch between <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disableText/> and <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disableText/> without entering <Skill name="Tailored Victory"/>. If you get <Skill name="Weave Self"/> off cd mid fight and the phase is long enough that you need to complete it then it is recommended to attune to <Skill name="Air Attunement" disableText/> and start from there because completing weave self otherwise is going to be a lot more awkward. 

- Hammer 3 orbs are an important part of your damage not only because of their offensive buff but also because they apply condis each time they hit the enemy (they hit once per second). That is why you want to have both <Skill name="Flame Wheel"/> and <Skill name="Rocky Loop"/> active for as longer as possible. Keep in mind that these buffs get activated together with <Skill id="69164"/> but you can only activate <Skill name="Flame Wheel"/> individually because you never double attune <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>. Eventually the cooldown of <Skill id="69164"/> starts being less aligned with the rotation which is why you go from throwing <Skill name="Grand Finale"/> before leaving <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/> to throwing it when you enter <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disable text/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement" disable text/> and then when you leave <Skill name="Earth Attunement" disable text/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement" disable text/>. If needed you can also use <Skill name="Grand Finale"/> in <Skill name="Fire Attunement" disable text/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement" disable text/> as long as you know <Skill id="69164"/> is going to be ready to activate.

<Card title="Precasting">

### **Precast in non boonstrip fights** 
If you know you can only get one <Skill name="Weave Self"/> during the fight then you can precast it and use the second one later. To do that you have to: 

- Start on <Skill name="Fire Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and precast <Skill name="Glyph of ELemental Power"/>, replace a utility with <Skill name="Arcane Power"/> and precast it.
- Attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Fire Attunement"/> and precast <Skill name="Weave Self"/>.
- Switch back your replaced utility.
- Take the _Mistlock Singularity_ and attune to <Skill name="Earth Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> for <Trait name="Elements of Rage"/>.
- Attune to <Skill name="Air Attunement"/>/<Skill name="Earth Attunement"/> and start the fight.

### **Precast in fights with boonstrip** 
In [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) and Silent Surf CMs boons and some specific buffs get stripped the moment you enter combat so your precast has to be adjusted. Also these fights favor use of <Skill name="Glyph of Lesser Elementals"/>.

### **Extra Precast for [Sunqua Peak](/fractals/sunqua-peak) and Silent Surf CMs**

If you have an extra set of weapons (or legendary sigils), you can also precast the effects of <Item name="Doom"/> and <Item name="Leeching"/>. To do that:

- Switch to the sigils.
- For Sunqua Peak fall below the stairs before the boss' arena to get in combat and switch to any attunement.
- For Silent Surf let go of the parachute a bit earlier so as you get in combat when you fall down and switch to any attunement. 
- Once you are out of combat, you can switch the sigils back to <Item name="Earth"/> and <Item name="Geomancy"/>.
